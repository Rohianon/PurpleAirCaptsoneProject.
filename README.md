# PurpleAirCaptsoneProject.
This is a project centered towards applying machine learning and time series algorithms in the air-quality sensor data. A device known as **[Purple Air](https://www2.purpleair.com/)** used to measure the Air quality especially particulate matter in the atmosphere was used for data collection since September 2019 to January 2020. The data was collected but there was none to make the sense out of the data and thus gave me an idea to delve deep into it and find out the insights. 

### Project Schedule.
