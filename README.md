# PurpleAirCaptsoneProject.
This is a project centered towards applying machine learning algorithms in the air-quality sensor data. A device known as **Purple Air** used to measure the Air quality especially particulate matter in the atmosphere was used for data collection since September 2019 to January 2020. The data was collected and but there was none to make the sense out of the data and thus gave me an idea to delve deep into it and find out the insights. 

<h2>Background of the project.</h2>
<p class="modelDetails">
		The model focuses on one specific type of air pollution: particulate matter that is 2.5 micrometers in diameter, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/12/02/climate/air-pollution-compare-ar-ul.html">commonly referred to as PM2.5</a>. Pollution particles this small can move deeply into human lungs. Research has linked PM2.5 exposure to <a href="https://www.epa.gov/pm-pollution/health-and-environmental-effects-particulate-matter-pm">many health problems</a>, including asthma, irregular heartbeat, nonfatal heart attacks, and premature death.
